SDRVTEST is a tool for testing whether a device or a SCSI Driver
implementation handles certain SCSI commands in compliance with the current
SCSI specification (https://www.t10.org).
The device does not necessarily have to be a SCSI device, but can be any
kind of device supported by a SCSI Driver. HDDRIVER provides SCSI Drivers not
only for SCSI devices but also for ACSI, IDE, ATAPI and SATA devices.
Any error reported by SDRVTEST ("ERROR" is displayed) means that most likely
something is either wrong with how the device handles SCSI commands, or with
the SCSI Driver managing the respective bus. If an optional SCSI command is
not supported this is not considered an error.
Applications may not work correctly with devices or SCSI Drivers for which
the executed tests fail.
SDRVTEST saves the test results in a file SDRVTEST.LOG in the current
directory and also displays the results on the screen.
NOTE: Currently only LUN 0 is tested.

MCHGTEST, ERRTEST and SERRTEST test other SCSI Driver features, related to
error handling and media changes. Please refer to the sources for details.
Except for writing the SDRVTEST logfile the tests do not write any data.
