With SDRVTEST you can test whether a SCSI Driver implementation is compliant
with the SCSI Driver specification 1.01, and whether a device handles certain
SCSI commands in compliance with the SCSI standard (https://www.t10.org).
The device does not necessarily have to be a SCSI device, but can be any
device manage by a SCSI Driver.
Any error reported by SDRVTEST (flagged in the output with "ERROR") means
that most likely something is either wrong with the SCSI Driver
implementation for the respective bus, or that the device (or device
emulation like SCSI2Pi or BlueSCSI) handles SCSI commands incorrectly. If an
optional SCSI command is not supported this is not considered an error.
Applications/drivers may not work correctly with devices or SCSI Drivers for
which a test fails.
SDRVTEST saves the test results to a file SDRVTEST.LOG in the current
directory and also displays the results on the screen.
NOTE: Currently only LUN 0 is tested.

MCHGTEST, ERRTEST and SERRTEST test other SCSI Driver features, related to
error handling and media changes. Please refer to the sources for details.
Except for the SDRVTEST logfile the tests do not change/write any data.
